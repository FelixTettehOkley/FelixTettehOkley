Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) using OpenVAS
Project Summary: Recently, I conducted a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on a network using OpenVAS. This assessment identified several critical and medium-level vulnerabilities that could impact the security posture of the network.

Key Vulnerabilities Discovered:
Weak Key Exchange (KEX) Algorithms Supported (SSH) (Severity: Medium, 5.3):
The use of outdated key exchange algorithms poses a risk of compromising secure communication channels.

Weak Host Key Algorithms (SSH) (Severity: Medium, 5.3):
The server supports weak host key algorithms, which could be exploited to intercept SSH connections.

FTP Unencrypted Cleartext Login (Severity: Medium, 4.8):
FTP allows unencrypted logins, potentially exposing sensitive information during transmission.

Telnet Unencrypted Cleartext Login (Severity: Medium, 4.8):
Similar to FTP, Telnet is configured for unencrypted logins, which increases the risk of credential theft.

Weak Encryption Algorithm(s) Supported (SSH) (Severity: Medium, 4.3):
The server is using weak encryption algorithms that could be vulnerable to decryption attacks.

TCP and ICMP Timestamps Information Disclosure (Severity: Low, 2.6 & 2.1):
TCP and ICMP timestamps can be exploited to gather information about the network, potentially aiding in timing attacks.

These vulnerabilities highlight the need for enhanced encryption standards, secure protocol configurations, and the elimination of legacy systems that support insecure practices.

Tools Used:
OpenVAS: A leading open-source tool for comprehensive vulnerability scanning and reporting.
Skills Gained: Network Security, Vulnerability Management, Encryption Standards, Secure Communication Protocols
